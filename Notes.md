# Notes

These are my notes for the telecommunication user churn project. Here I will note down my thoughts on EDA, deployment, model selection, and whatever else I think is relevant.

As of now, I am creating a model for Customer Status and Churn Category. The EDA approach so far has been using the relationship between the features and the target. I will now explore the relationship between the features themselves i.e using PCA to reduce dimensionality.
